<h4>Hacktoberfest is digitalocean's annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout october. Much of modern tech infrstructure including some of digitalocean's own products-relies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don't have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all the things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.<h4>

$ cd HacktoberFest-2023
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

### 3. Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/HacktoberFest-2023.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/HacktoberFest-2023.git (push)
```

Now, let's add a reference to the original [Hacktoberfest-2023](https://github.com/Fork-N-Forge/HacktoberFest-2023) repository using


### 4. Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of the repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

$ git reset --hard upstream/main
# Push changes to your forked `HacktoberFest-2023` repo

### 5. Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to contribute. Please create a separate branch using command and keep your `main` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```

Create a separate branch for contribution and try to use the same name of the branch as of folder.

To switch to the desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout BranchName
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use
